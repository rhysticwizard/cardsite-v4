# Multi-Select Implementation for Deckbuilder

## Overview
Successfully implemented desktop-style multi-select functionality for the deckbuilder component, similar to the playmat implementation. Users can now select multiple cards and perform batch operations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Selection Behavior
- **Click and drag** to create selection rectangles around cards ✅
- **Ctrl+Click** to toggle individual cards in/out of selection ✅
- **Escape key** to clear all selections ✅
- **Click empty space** to clear selections ✅
- **Visual feedback** with blue outline/glow on selected cards ✅

### 2. Multi-Select Features
- **Batch operations**: Remove all selected cards, move to sideboard, move to main deck ✅
- **Selection persistence**: Cards stay selected until explicitly cleared ✅
- **Visual indicators**: Selected cards maintain blue outline ✅
- **Formation preservation**: Batch operations work across categories ✅

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified
- `cardsite/hooks/use-multi-select.ts` - **NEW** Reusable multi-select hook
- `cardsite/components/mtg/deck-builder-client.tsx` - Main deckbuilder integration
- `cardsite/components/mtg/deck-card.tsx` - Visual card component updates
- `cardsite/components/mtg/deck-card-text.tsx` - Text view card component updates  
- `cardsite/components/mtg/deck-column.tsx` - Column component updates

#### Key Components

**Multi-Select Hook (`use-multi-select.ts`)**
- Reusable hook for any component that needs multi-select
- Handles drag selection rectangles
- Provides intersection testing interface
- Manages keyboard events (Escape to clear)
- Global mouse event handling

**State Management**
```typescript
const {
  selectedItems: selectedCards,
  setSelectedItems: setSelectedCards,
  isSelecting,
  selectionStart,
  selectionEnd,
  clearSelection,
  toggleItemSelection,
  startSelection,
  getSelectionRectangle,
  handleContainerClick,
  justCompletedSelection
} = useMultiSelect({
  items: allDeckCards,
  getItemId: (card: DeckCardData) => card.id,
  intersectionTest: (card: DeckCardData, rect) => {
    // DOM-based intersection testing
  },
  enabled: !isViewMode
});
```

**Batch Operations**
```typescript
// Remove all selected cards
handleBatchRemove()

// Move selected cards to sideboard  
handleBatchMoveToSideboard()

// Move selected sideboard cards to main deck
handleBatchMoveToMainDeck()

// Clear all selections
clearSelection()
```

#### Visual Components

**Selection Rectangle Overlay**
- Fixed positioned overlay that follows mouse drag
- Blue border with transparent background
- Only appears when dragging selection rectangle
- Automatically disappears for small selections

**Card Visual Feedback**
- Selected cards show blue ring and shadow
- Works in both visual and text modes
- Consistent styling across all card types

**Batch Operation Controls**
- Fixed bottom-right panel when cards are selected
- Shows count of selected cards
- Provides Remove All, To Sideboard, To Main Deck, and Clear buttons
- Auto-hides when no cards selected

### 4. Integration Details

#### Card Intersection Testing
Uses DOM-based intersection testing with `data-card-id` attributes:
```typescript
intersectionTest: (card: DeckCardData, rect) => {
  const cardElement = document.querySelector(`[data-card-id="${card.id}"]`);
  if (!cardElement) return false;
  
  const cardRect = cardElement.getBoundingClientRect();
  // Rectangle intersection logic
}
```

#### Prop Threading
Multi-select props are threaded through the component hierarchy:
- `DeckBuilderClient` → `DeckColumn` → `DeckCard`/`DeckCardText`
- `selectedCards: Set<string>` - Currently selected card IDs
- `onCardClick: (cardId, event) => void` - Card click handler for Ctrl+Click

#### Event Handling
- Container `onMouseDown` for starting drag selection
- Container `onClick` for clearing selection on empty space click
- Card `onClick` for individual card selection with Ctrl modifier
- Global mouse events for drag rectangle management
- Global keyboard events for Escape key handling

## Usage

### Basic Selection
1. **Drag Selection**: Click and drag in empty space to create selection rectangle
2. **Individual Selection**: Ctrl+Click on cards to toggle selection
3. **Clear Selection**: Press Escape or click empty space

### Batch Operations
1. Select multiple cards using any selection method
2. Batch controls appear in bottom-right corner
3. Choose desired operation:
   - **Remove All**: Permanently delete selected cards
   - **To Sideboard**: Move cards from main deck to sideboard
   - **To Main Deck**: Move cards from sideboard to appropriate categories
   - **Clear**: Clear selection without making changes

## Implementation Notes

### Grid Layout Adaptation
- Adapted intersection detection for grid-based card layout (vs playmat's free positioning)
- Accounts for card stacking in visual mode
- Works with both visual and text view modes

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced selection updates during drag
- Efficient DOM queries using data attributes
- Minimal re-renders through proper React optimization

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support (Escape key)
- Screen reader compatible (proper ARIA labels on buttons)
- Visual focus indicators

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly batch operation buttons
- Proper touch event handling through dnd-kit sensors
- Responsive button sizing

## Testing Checklist ✅
- [x] Selection rectangle appears on drag
- [x] Cards highlight when selected  
- [x] Ctrl+Click toggles individual cards
- [x] Escape clears selection
- [x] Batch operations work correctly
- [x] Selection persists across UI updates
- [x] Works in both visual and text modes
- [x] Mobile/touch compatibility
- [x] Performance with 100+ cards
- [x] No conflicts with existing drag/drop

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements that could be added:
- **Select All/None buttons** in the batch controls
- **Selection by card type/color filters**
- **Copy/paste selected cards between decks**
- **Bulk quantity adjustments**
- **Selection history/undo**
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Ctrl+A for select all, Delete for remove)
