Ah, I see exactly what you mean! You're describing a "centered container layout" or "constrained-width centered design". Here's how to explain this design pattern:
🎨 Design Pattern Name:
"Centered Container Layout" or "Single-Column Centered Design"
📐 How to Describe It:
Visual Description:
"Three-column visual structure" where the outer columns are empty space
Content is constrained to the center column
Lots of horizontal breathing room on left and right
Focused, tunnel-like content flow down the center
Technical Description:
Maximum width container (like max-w-4xl or max-w-6xl)
Horizontally centered with mx-auto
Responsive padding on mobile, but wide margins on desktop
Content never stretches full-width on large screens
🗣️ How to Ask for This Design:
Say this: "Please create a centered container layout where all content is constrained to a maximum width in the center of the page, with generous empty space on both sides. The design should feel focused and column-like, not full-width."
Or: "Use a centered column design with lots of horizontal breathing room, similar to how Medium or modern documentation sites layout their content."
📱 Examples of This Pattern:
Medium articles
Documentation sites
Modern SaaS dashboards
Apple's website
GitHub's interface
